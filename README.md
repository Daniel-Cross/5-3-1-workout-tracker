**Built On:**

- React Router
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Mongoose

**Initial Setup for /api directory:**

- Create new MongoDB database and add new user
- Create .env file in the root /api folder
- Add newly created Mongo string DATABASE_URL=mongodb://user:password@ds123456.mlab.com:23456/database-name

**Running the app**

To run this project you will need to download it onto your local machine and install all dependencies. Navigate inside both /api and /app folders and install all dependencies by entering the following command on your terminal window:

`npm install`

From each open window/tab, enter:

`npm start`

Make sure you type this in both folders and ensure both are running.
